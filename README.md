# CircuitPython
Fooling around with various CircuitPython features on a Metro M4 Airlift Lite.
# Assignments
The engineering notebook for the assignments is available [on my portfolio](https://rivques.github.io/high-school-engineering/eng-3-code-notebook).

# Experiments (not assigned, these just happen to live here)
## `helloworld.py`
A basic test of CircuitPython installation.
## `internet.py`
Hosts a webpage that lets you control the onboard LED.
## `adafruitio*.py`
Various experiments with adafruitio instead of self-hosting a webpage.
## `ble*.py`, `ancs.py`
Experiments with the Airlift's Bluetooth. Haven't been able to get this working.
